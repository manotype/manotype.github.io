              <p>Simply put, I believe a brand‚Äôs actions speak louder than their words (though, those certainly matter too). Human-centered design in the modern enterprise brings competitive advantage by discovering customers‚Äô latent needs and subsequently delivering desirable customer experiences. And, when design and data science come together, smart systems seamlessly drive personalized, data-driven touchpoints and adds meaningful value to people‚Äôs lives. To me, that‚Äôs the quintessence of design.

              <h2>Site details</h2>
              <p>This site was designed on paper‚Äîokay, the digital paper known as iPad Pro‚Äîand produced in Sketch. I then built this in React JS/Next JS, so if it‚Äôs a little buggy, please forgive me. I‚Äôm more of a prototype developer and you probably don‚Äôt want me pushing your production-level code. I wanted to learn React and see what all the ado was about, so this is the first thing I‚Äôve made with it. I highly anticipate refactoring about 75% of this code now that I‚Äôve shipped something. <span role="img" aria-label="Thumbs up">üëç</span></p>
